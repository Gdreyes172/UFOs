## Overview
### Using Javascript and HTML we helped create a webpage that could parse through the data provided and display it on the webpage. In addition, the project focused on a way to filter the data per a user interface.

## Results
### The data provided displayed the following information respectively; date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments to display UFO sightings. The goal was to be able to allow a visitor on the website to see and the filter the table based on their category of interest.

### Based on the data provided, additional updates to the website should focus on the way the information is filtered. Upon going through the data, it was obvious that the user could not search by any given. The data showed that the dates are specific to the month of January 2010. Furthermore, there are only two countries to mentioned and a handful of unique shapes mentioned. The most dynamic information found in the table are the US states where sightings occured. To me, this means a selection menu would be better suited for this project. 
## Conclusion:
### Consider a new way to filter the data due to the minimal choices available for the user. A drop-down filter like in excel would be great due to the few choices available for each category.
