## Overview
### Using Javascript and HTML we help create a webpage that could parse through the data provided and display it on the webpage. In addition, the project focused on a way to filter the data per a user interface.

## Results
### The data provided diplayed the following information repectively; date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments in order to display UFO sightings. The goal was to be able to allow a visitor to see the filter and search based on their interest date, city, etc...

### Based on the data provided, some additional updates should focus on the way the information is filtered. It was obvious that not any given date could be found when you try to filter. In fact, a quick look at the data will show you that the dates are specific to the month of January, there are only two countries to choose from, and there is only a handfull of unique shapes mentioned. The most dynamic information found in the table are the US states. To me, this means a selection menu would be better suited for this project. 
## Conclusion:
### Consider a new way to filter the data due to the minimal choices available for the user. A drop down filter like in excel would be great due to the few choices available for each category.
